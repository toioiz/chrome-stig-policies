If the information of what sites are being accessed is made available to unauthorized persons, this violates confidentiality requirements, and over time poses a significant OPSEC issue. This policy setting allows you to set whether websites are allowed to track the user’s physical location. Tracking the user’s physical location can be allowed by default, denied by default or the user can be asked every time a website requests the physical location.
